## Not Maintaining, Just Fixing
Currently fixing this extension until it works on my system, not for mass use yet.

This means I am not testing this extension against every player and every version of gnome-shell, hence "not maintaining".

Do NOT use this (yet).

* Should work in all indicator positions, Gnome-Shell 3.34.5. Not all options tested.

Based on the work of horazont (Jonas Wielicki).

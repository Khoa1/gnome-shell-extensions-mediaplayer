## Not Maintaining, Just Fixing For My Use
Currently fixing this extension until it works on my system, not for mass use.

I am not extensively testing this extension against every player and every version of gnome-shell, hence "not maintaining". (Also, I don't know exactly what I'm doing quite yet :P. This extension touches a lot of things I'm learning from, documented or not)

There are problems with this, but it currently works on my Gnome-Shell 3.34.5.
